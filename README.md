# Mobile App Testing and Performance Testing Project
## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform mobile application testing on the **MX Player App** using **Java** and **JavaScript**. The testing process includes **automation testing** using tools like **Selenium** and **Appium**. Performance testing was conducted using the **REST API** as a simulated backend.
